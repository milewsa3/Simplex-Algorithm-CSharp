# Simplex-Algorithm-CSharp
Simplex algorithm written in C#. It is helpful tool for solving a linear programming problems.
Normal Simplex Algorythm can calculate minimum and maximum of the function. In it's restrictions it can also have like equasions with signs: >= , =, <=.
I didn't need all of this functionalities, so this version is a little bit truncated.
# There are two restrictions about this version:
- you can only calculate a minimum of the function
- while defining constraints, you can only use <= and = sign

Nevertheless, I hope that it might become useful for somebody. Peace.
